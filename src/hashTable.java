public class hashTable {
    /**
     * address= key%n   n=number of available address
       folding method divide key into equal parts then add parts together(using any sorts of things such as ASCI values
       Collision- when two items with equal keys have to be inputed, traverse the array till a value an empty space
        is found
            Called open addressing- different methods
                    linear probing can be used, once at the end, can cycle to begining till one is found
            Conflict resolution for bunshing- every third or Quadratic probing(failed attempts)
                    double hashing
       LOAD FACTOR- (Total num of items stored)/ size of array, the lower the load factor the MORE REASONABLE OPEN ADDRESSING BECOMES

       Chaining/closed addressing- every position is the start to a node in a linked list
            advantages-
                    Simple to implement
                    Hash table never fills up
                    less sensitive to hash function or load factors
                    MOSTLY USED WHEN- it is unknoq or uncertain the frequency of insertion and deletion
            Disadvantages- cache performance is poor
                    Wastage of space

       The higher
